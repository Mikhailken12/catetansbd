* Overlapping
- ﻿﻿an instance of the higher-level entity set can belong to multiple lower-level entity sets at the same time.
* ﻿﻿Disjoint
- ﻿﻿an instance of the higher-level entity set can belong to only one lower-level entity set

REPRESENTING SPECIALIZATION
AS SCHEMAS (CONT.)
* ﻿﻿Method 1:
* ﻿﻿Form a schema for the higher-level entity
* ﻿﻿Form a schema for each lower-level entity set, include primary key of higher-level entity set and local attributes
* 
schema	attributes
person	ID, name, street, city
student	ID, tot_cred
employee	ID, salary
* 
• Drawback: getting information about an employee requires accessing two relations, the one corresponding to the low-level schema and the one corresponding to the high-level schema
* 
* A bottom-up design process - combine a number of entity sets that share the same features into a higher-level entity set.
* ﻿﻿Specialization and generalization are simple inversions of each other; they are represented in an E-R diagram in the same way.
* ﻿﻿The terms specialization and generalization are used interchangeably.

Data Redundancy occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple places within a database.
Types of Redundancy:
Why Redundancy is a
• Attribute Redundancy:
Concern:
- Duplicate attributes across
• Data Inconsistency: Risk of
different tables.
data being updated in one
• Example: Student names stored in both 'Student Data'
place but not the other.
and 'Grades' tables.
• Storage Wastage:
• Row Redundancy:
Unnecessary use of
- Identical or highly similar
storage space.
rows within a single table.
• Example: Two identical entries for a student.

Relationships
* ﻿﻿Enrolls: A many-to-many relationship between Student and Course.
* ﻿﻿Offers: A one-to-many relationship between Department and Course.
* ﻿﻿Belongs to: A many-to-one relationship between Student and Department.
Creating Aggregation
• Resolve the redundancy with aggregation.
• Create a new entity, say Enrollment, which aggregates the relationship between Student and Course.
• Then establish a relationship between Enrollment and Department through the
"Offered by" relationship.
This structure removes the redundancy by ensuring that the department information is only directly associated with the course enrollment, thereby avoiding inconsistencies and simplifying maintenance.
