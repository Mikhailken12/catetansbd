The method for designing a relational database is to use a process commonly known as normalization. The goal is to generate a set of relation schemas that allows us to store information without unnecessary redundancy, yet also allows us to retrieve information easily.
The approach is:
1. Decide if a given relation schema is in 'good form."
2. If a given relation schema is not in "good form," then we decompose it into a number of smaller relation schemas, each of which is in an appropriate normal form.
To determine whether a relation schema is in one of the desiral normal forms, we need additional information about the real-world enterprise that we are modeling with the database. The most common approach is to use functional dependencies.
These anomalies naturally occur and result in data that does not match the real-world the database purports to represent. Anomalies are caused when there is too much redundancy in the database's information.
Anomalies can often be caused when the tables that make up the database suffer from poor construction.
There are three kind of anomalies:
- Insert Anomaly
â€¢ Delete Anomaly
Update Anomaly
Insert Anomalies
Occurs when certain attributes cannot be inserted into the database without the presence of other attributes.
Ex: we can't add a new course unless we have at least one student enrolled on the course (this is the converse of delete anomaly).

For a table to be in the Second Normal Form:
Rule 1:
It should be in the First Normal Form.
Rule 2:
It should not have Partial Dependency.
Before we start, let's find out what is Partial Dependency.
X

A is functionally depends on X.
X+ Y

A is partially depends on (X+Y).
